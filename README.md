# Bagpipe Writer

While studying tunes in bagpipes, I've found a very useful software called [Bagpipe Player](https://bagpipe.eotrs.dk/). It helps a lot with training and tempo but it lacks in user interface to write a single piece or manage a already constructed one.

This a web tool capable to write **.bww** files using a graphic interface and the main objective is to help pipers to write new tunes (whole pieces or training movements) and manage already created files one may find elsewhere.
